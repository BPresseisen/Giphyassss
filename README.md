# Giphyassss

This helps users create an current session (not persistent) archive of giphs to display in both an animated and still state.

The application is a deployed solution of an AJAX call and how to render elements (buttons, divs, and objects) to the page dynamically.

The application's strength lies in its minimal yet effective design.

5 topic-buttons are automatically rendered to the top of page: Purim, tennis, sandwiches, beer, and Air Jordans

Click on any of them and the AJAX call returns an object with 10 key:value properties containing giphs pursuant to the topic-buttons. 

Click on any other button and the previous search is wiped-clean, thus paving the way for the new 10 giphs to be drawn to the screen. 

As the giphs appear, they are shown in the still (or non-animated) state. As the giph is clicked, the state changes to the animated state and continues behaving in this way until clicked again. 

And if the user is curious to add more buttons, and thus render more giphs by topic, the search and add buttons functions/routines make it all possible.

It's better than Giphy, it's GiphYASSSS
