# Giphyassss

This helps users create a topical archive of giphs in both the animated and paused versions.

The application is also a deployed solution to use an AJAX call and how to dynamically render elements (buttons, divs, and objects) to the page.

The application's strength is its minimal yet effective design.

5 topic-buttons are automatically rendered to the top of page: Purim, tennis, sandwiches, beer, and Air Jordans

Click on any of them and the AJAX call returns an object with 10 key:value properties containing giphs pursuant to the topic-buttons. Click on any other button and the previous search is wiped-clean, thus paving the way for the new 10 giphs to be drawn to the screen. As the giphs appear, they are shown in the still (or non-animated) state. As the giph is clicked, the state changes tot he animated state and continues behaving in this way until clicked again. 

And if the user is curious to add more
